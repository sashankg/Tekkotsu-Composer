# Tekkotsu-Composer
Drag-and-drop state machine composer for Tekkotu Robotics Framework developed with Professor David Touretzky of CMU

## About
The Teokkotsu Robotics Framework utilizes state machines written in C++ to manage control flow in the application, a vision system, and an automatically maintained world map. I was tasked with designing and developing a web application to allow composition of state machines without needing to write C++ code, which would give high schoolers an easier platform to learn computer science and robotics.
